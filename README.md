# SmallStack
Design &amp; Simulation of a Simple Forth-Inspired Stack Machine

TODO: Add links to references, explain the purpose and goals of this project.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Design Goals:
	- Have fun & learn
	- Simple, Small, Minimalistic Design (Minimal Instruction Set Computer)
	- Have a design that still remains useful despite its simplicity
		- Don't get stuck in 'Turing Tarpit'
		- Support ~ 1k instruction words in ROM
	- Be different, to challenge my assumptions and force myself to think outside the box
		- Originally began with 6-bit design.  Why? minimum number to support alphanumeric charset.
	- Ended up with 12-bit design, packing two chars per word.

Research:
	- Discovered that "Minimal Instruction Set Computer" is a real thing: MISC
	- The life's work of Charles Moore, an unsung genius of our time.
		- Computer Cowboys, Ultratechnology, Greenarrays
		- Stack Computers, RPN, and Forth.
