- Create bi-directional bus tristate buffer component
- Create up-down counter component (4 bit and 12 bit versions, or 4 bit cascadable)
	- This will be used for the PC, and also the stack sizes
- Create shift registers, some power of 2 size large, possibly 8 or 16
	- This will be used for a 'column' in the stack
- Create stack component.
	- dual-read ported on top two elements.
	- push/pop control lines
	- ability to read size via control line assert
- Create general purpose register
- Create ALU
	- Adder/Subtractor
	- Equality comparator only (no magnitude - yet - 2.0)
	- logical subset
	- negate
	- shift by one +/-
	- special load hex operation - load 4 low bits and shift all others up.
	- char swap - swap low 6 with high 6

- Control unit
	- Instruction register split into opcodes
	- in parallel with hardwired fetch cycle microcode
	- microcode pc counter controls a mux through micro opcodes 
	- two decoders - one for reader and one for writer
		- minimize the number of bus targets
		- ALU inputs hardwired to data stack, and dumps directly
		  back to data bus.  it is the writer in an op.
		- memory unit

- Memory Unit upgrades.
	- three r/w data bus interfaces: PC, AR, MEM
	- state machine between PC control and Addr Reg control.
		- default is latched to PC control
		- override with a write to AR
		- resets after a read or write to MEM
